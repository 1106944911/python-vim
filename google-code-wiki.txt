= What is this? =

_(my english may sound strange. I'm not stupid... well, I don't know... but this is because I'm not a native english speaker. If you find an error, tell me!)_

This is my personal vim configuration, built according to my personal preferences, without any justification to think it's the best possible vim configuration. If you like it, great! :)
It's mainly oriented to python software development, but many of its features are useful for other languages and editing tasks.

Feel free to distribute it (it's GPL licensed), and I'm not responsible for any good or bad consecuences of using it (I don't know how a vim configuration can harm you, but you should never underestimate the power of vim :p).

You can report any issue on the Issues section. And if you need/want to contact me, my gmail account is "fisadev".

= Features or it didn't happen! =

Most important features include:

 * *Smart autocompletition as you type*, sometimes using python instrospection (completition of module names, instance methods and attributes) and sometimes text-based (used words).

 * *Fuzzy file and code finder* (like Textmante or Sublime Text 2):
    * ,e = open file (like the original :e) but with recursive and fuzzy file name matching. Example: if you type "mopy" it will find a file named "models.py" placed on a subdirectory.
    * ,t = same as ",e", but opens the file on a new tab.
    * ,g = fuzzy symbol finder (classes, methods, variables, functions, ...) on the current file. Example: if you type "usr" it will find the User class definition on the current file.
    * ,f = fuzzy text finder on the current file. Example: if you type "ctm=6" it will find the line containing "current_time = 16".

 * *Classes/module browser* that lists classes, functions, methods, and such of the current file, and navigates to them when ENTER is pressed. Toggle it with "F4".

 * *Pending tasks browser* pressing "F2". This reads the current file searching for comments that start with "TODO", "FIXME", and such, and shows them on a list that allows navigation similar to the class browser.

 * *Error checking of python code* using Pyflakes (it will detect unused variables or imports, syntax errors, and such).

 * A really nice *python and php debugger*. Small tutorial about it:

   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kairdgZCD1U&feature=player_embedded 

   I added some keyboard shortcuts to easy its usage (they should be used only once the debugger started!):
    * F5 = step over
    * F6 = step into
    * F7 = step out
    * F8 = execute until cursor position is reached
    * F9 = toggle breakpoint
    * F10 = evaluate expressions on the expressions window (watch)
    * F11 = go down on the stack
    * F12 = go up on the stack

   You should watch the video tutorial, I can't explain all its usage here.

   FAQ: Why there isn't a keyboard shortcut to start the debugger?

   Because there where no more "Fx" keys free, and starting the debugger is something you do only once on every debugging session, compared to the multiple times you will use the other functions on that session. Disagree? Change it! Edit the .vimrc file, is really simple and well documented :).  (The command to start the debugger on the current file is ":Dbg .")

 * *Better python syntax coloring*.

 * *Better python indentation*.

 * Some settings for better *tabs and spaces handling*.

 * *Better file browser*, toggle it with "F3".

 * *Results count* while searching text.

 * *Search and read python documentation* with the ":Pydoc" command. Example:
   * :Pydoc collections

 * *Comment and uncomment code* with "\ci".

 * *Easy tab navigation* on command mode:
    * tt = new tab and leaves the cursor waiting to specify the file path to open (leave blank to open an empty tab).
    * tn = next tab.
    * tp = previous tab.
    * tm = move current tab to the end.

 * Some vim goodies enabled by default: *incremental search* (moves to the first result while you are typing), *highlighted search results*, and *line numbers*.

 * *Python interpreter inside vim*, or any other console. They are opened as a buffer using the command ":!ConqueTerm". Example:
   * :!ConqueTerm python
   * :!ConqueTerm bash

 * *Save current file as sudo* using ":w!!".

 * *Navigate html/xml tags* the same way that you navigate (), {} and `[]`: using "%".

 * *Status bar allways visible*.

 * *Automatically removes trailing spaces* when saving python files.

 * Highlights *long (80+) lines*, *trailing spaces* and *lines starting with tabs* on python files. From version 1.5 the long lines highlighting is off by default. All this stuff can be toggle editing the file .vim/bundle/highlight-bad-python/ftplugin/python.vim

 * *Similar color scheme on vim and gvim*.

 * *Plugins managed using Pathogen*! If you want to disable a plugin, simply remove its folder from .vim/bundle/ .

= 2 steps installation =

(you will need a vim compiled with python support. Check it with vim --version | grep +python)

=== 1) Put the configuration files where they belong ===

Copy the files .vimrc and .gvimrc, and the folder .vim (all of them contained on the .tar.gz file) to your linux home folder.

Example: my linux user is "fisa", so now I have this tree:

{{{
/home/fisa/.vimrc
/home/fisa/.gvimrc
/home/fisa/.vim/
}}}

=== 2) Install dependencies ===

{{{
sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
sudo pip install dbgp
sudo pip install vim-debug
}}}

(if you don't have Pip, find it here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip )

Done! You have your new shiny powerful vim :)

Thanks to some people from [http://python.org.ar PyAr], who show me vim for the first time and shared their configurations with me on the !PyCamp 2010 :). Some of my tweaks were copied from their configurations.
